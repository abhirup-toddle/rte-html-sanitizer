Here are the three elements of a good Paper 2 introduction:</span></p><ol><li><span>a “</span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">hook</strong></b><span>”: grabs your reader’s attention and interest </span></li><li><span>a </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">bridge</strong></b><span>: brief introduction/overview of your two works; related to the question; ties “hook” to thesis </span></li><li><span>a </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">thesis* </strong></b><span>statement that links both works and provides an idea of how they will be explored in relation to each other in response to the selected question.</span></li></ol><p class="tde-paragraph"></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">*You will need to have written your thesis statement and created an outline before you compose your introduction. The activities below are designed to follow the “Great Introductions: Part 1” and “Organizing &amp; Outlining Your Paper 2” activities.</strong></b></p><ol><li><span>The “</span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">hook</strong></b><span>”: its job is to engage the reader from the very first sentence </span><i><em class="tde-text-italic">and </em></i><span>set the stage for the focus at hand. This means that your hook shouldn’t just sound nice; it should also lead logically into #2. </span></li><li><span>Your “</span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">bridge</strong></b><span>” (brief overview of each work) is important for two reasons: 1) your examiner may need some reminders about the content of your chosen work (examiners read and teach a lot of different works, so it may have been years since they’ve read your selection!); and 2) it should link to the Paper 2 question. In other words, in a few sentences, you want to refresh your reader’s memory regarding the two works </span><i><em class="tde-text-italic">and</em></i><span> do so in a way that clearly relates to the topic at hand. </span></li></ol><p class="tde-paragraph"></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">Quick tip for great introductions: THINK IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS!</strong></b></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>The IB Program encourages conceptual thinking because it leads to new insights, creative innovation, and independent reasoning. When it comes to literary study, broad concepts can provide a “way in” to a text or pair of texts </span><i><em class="tde-text-italic">and</em></i><span> help you connect literature to real life. After all, we read literature in order to learn more about ourselves, others, and the world around us, and – hopefully – to become better human beings as a result. Thus, if you can think about a work you’re reading in terms of what it might teach us about, say, the importance of </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">perspective</strong></b><span>, you might better appreciate the work’s real-life significance.</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><img src="https://cloud.toddleapp.com/thumber/fit-in/1080x1080/https://cloud.toddleapp.com/eu-west-1/p/_oaXnWM/content/rt/uploads/lMLQHN4R5v/hcjohDgOf.png" height="166" width="303" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 13.21.49.png" /></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">What does this mean for Paper 2?</strong></b></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>As you respond to a question, think about it – and your selected works – in relation to one or more of the </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">course concepts</strong></b><span>. Sometimes, a Paper 2 question will explicitly address a course concept (such as the question, “Often a change of scenery can lead to a change in perspective. Discuss how two of your authors have made use of this idea and to what effect”). Other times, </span><i><em class="tde-text-italic">you</em></i><span> might need to make the connection. For example, which concepts might relate to, or be illuminated by, this question: “Many works of literature suggest that freedom is often sacrificed for the sake of stability. How do at least two literary works you have studied explore this issue?”</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Perhaps you plan to discuss two novels in which young people “come of age” and find their own </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">identity </strong></b><span>as they seek freedom; or you might discuss two works in which an understanding of what it means to be “free” might be shaped by </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">perspective </strong></b><span>or </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">communication</strong></b><span>,</span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">,</strong></b><span> or you might explore the </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">transformation</strong></b><span> a character undergoes over the course of a story as he makes a choice to relinquish freedom in favour of stability. You might discuss how a writer portrays the idea of freedom through </span><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">creativity</strong></b><span>.
