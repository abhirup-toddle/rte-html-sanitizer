Contrary to the belief that environmental issues can only be solved through deep scientific knowledge, the humanities and social sciences play a crucial role. They provide a unique approach to connecting the public with environmental concerns, often missed by the scientific community's complex jargon and methodologies.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>These disciplines have a history of driving social change, impossible through science alone. By crafting narratives and offering policy-supporting data, they engage the public on a personal level, making complex environmental issues more relatable.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Political science professor Michael Ross emphasizes the importance of politics in environmental issues, stating, \"The solutions are not mysterious... The real problem is politics.\" His focus is on how cultural, political, and economic factors, especially in the U.S., shape our approach to climate change. Political science, with its data gathering and analysis skills, is vital in this context.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Similarly, humanities deepen our understanding by highlighting how different cultures perceive environmental changes. Ursula Heise, interim director of the Lab for Environmental Narrative Strategies, notes the influence of colonization histories on global perception of ecological crises. These insights are crucial for global understanding, especially in non-western nations and the global south.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Susanna Hecht, a professor at the Brazil Center and Institute of Environmental Studies, points out the role of indigenous cultures in expressing their experiences with climate change through literature and art. These narratives offer perspectives often overlooked in scientific discourse.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Moreover, humanities and social sciences share fundamental research concepts with traditional science, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration. For instance, both political science and environmental science use data analysis and surveying methods.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Environmental history is another field where the humanities intersect with science. Environmental historians use both scientific data and human records, including indigenous writings in Latin America dating back 4,000 years, to provide a comprehensive view of environmental issues.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Hecht encourages students in humanities and social sciences to explore environmental subjects, stating, \"Get out of your building, go wander around. There‚Äôs wonderful things going on.\" This call to action highlights the necessity for all disciplines to engage in the critical study of the environment, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in addressing environmental challenges.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/12/humanities-social-sciences-are-necessary-to-inform-environmental-studies\" class=\"tde-link\"><span class=\"tde-text-underline\">https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/12/humanities-social-sciences-are-necessary-to-inform-environmental-studies</span></a></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Last Accessed: 19/12/2023</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Discuss the various elements of this text and how they contribute towards conveying a particular social message.</strong></b></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>",
  "<ol><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Nostalgic Tone</strong></b><span>: The author's long-standing relationship with Almora lends a tone of nostalgia to the travelogue. Phrases like \"I prefer the memories of a distant past\" and the detailed recollections of sunsets and the smell of pine create a wistful atmosphere that pervades the narrative.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Intimate Knowledge</strong></b><span>: The author's detailed descriptions of the natural surroundings, the wildlife, and the changing landscapes indicate an intimate knowledge of the area, which can only come from spending significant time and forming deep connections with the place.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Subjective Perspective</strong></b><span>: The narrative is highly subjective, focusing on the author's personal experiences, memories, and emotions rather than providing an objective account of the place. This subjectivity draws readers into the author's personal world.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Evocative Imagery</strong></b><span>: The author's connection allows for rich, evocative imagery that vividly brings to life the scenes from Almora's past. The rainbow in the valley, the cobbled market, and the flying squirrels all serve to immerse the reader in the author's personal experience of the place.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Sense of Loss and Change</strong></b><span>: The author's perspective is one of someone who has witnessed change over time. There is a sense of loss for the Almora of the past, now replaced by the \"haphazard concrete of the district town\" and the \"traffic snarls.\"</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Contrast Between Past and Present</strong></b><span>: The travelogue is structured around a contrast between the idyllic past and the busy present of Almora, highlighting how the author's connection to the place has endured despite these changes.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Emotional Resonance</strong></b><span>: The travelogue resonates emotionally because it is not just about a place but about the author's life journey. Phrases like \"the dream that was no longer a dream‚Ä¶it was a lifetime to be lived\" reveal how Almora is intertwined with the author's identity.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Philosophical Reflections</strong></b><span>: The author's connection to the place elicits philosophical musings about the nature of belonging and existence, as seen in the contemplation of whether Almora was a \"conjunction of time, space, people.\"</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Transformational Experience</strong></b><span>: The personal connection is not just about the past; it's about transformation. The author speaks of how they have grown and found anew elsewhere the essence of what they loved about Almora.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Personal and Collective Memory</strong></b><span>: While the narrative is personal, it also acknowledges a collective memory and experience, especially in the mention of friends and shared moments, which broadens the perspective to include a shared human experience.</span></li></ol>",

Just after the milestone that says 2 kms to Almora, at Bright End Corner, I spent three years watching every sunset that was a symbol of the glory of the day completed. If I shut my eyes, in the space between the hills of Almora and Sitlakhet, was the Kosi river that flows below. Somewhere in the azure skies, somewhere in the thin wave of mist, somewhere in the setting sun and the changing colours of the skies, somewhere in the inky blue skies of night with the Milky Way stretching forever, the falcon flew and stopped mid-flight to remain suspended for an age without a name.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>I remember the summer evening I first reached Almora, and the rainbow in the valley before me.

The smell of pine, and the feel of a bed of pine leaves to walk on, with pine cones strewn. Wild flowers that coloured the hills. Flying squirrels that glided from tree to tree at dusk. The chameleon that popped it‚Äôs head out from behind a stone and stared quizzically. Afternoons spent on the rocky banks of the Kosi and Saryu rivers.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>And the friends. There were many.

His travelogue transcends mere description, instead becoming a potent vehicle for an underlying message that challenges the status quo. Through the use of personal anecdotes, contrasting imagery, and thematic juxtapositions, Bowling communicates the urgency of reevaluating the American societal framework from the vantage point of his travels. The narrative style is not just a recount of experiences but a transformative lens, revealing the discrepancies between the American justice system and those abroad, and the subsequent implications for his role as an educator. Thus, Bowling's travelogue serves as both a lens and a mirror, offering insights into societal constructs while reflecting on the pedagogical implications of these observations.</span></li></ol><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bowling begins with a personal ritual of packing a red &amp; black backpack, which immediately grounds his narrative in relatable human experience. His response to a colleague's question about feeling black in Germany opens a dialogue that not only conveys his sense of liberation while traveling but also subtly critiques the racial tensions he experiences at home. These anecdotes serve as a fulcrum for the travelogue, allowing Bowling to pivot between his personal narrative and the broader social issues, connecting with his readers on an emotional level.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>The vivid contrast between the perceived freedom in Germany and the tense social climate in America is striking. Bowling's imagery of being \"black + carefree\" juxtaposed with the harsh reality of police violence back home sharpens the reader's understanding of the systemic issues in America. This stylistic choice not only highlights the disparity but also prompts the reader to consider the varying roles of law enforcement in different societies.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bowling's travelogue is marked by its thematic juxtapositions; he contrasts the somber reminders of racial injustices with the rich educational experiences gleaned from travel. He utilizes his personal transformations abroad to critique the systemic issues plaguing his homeland, such as police brutality and the commodification of incarceration. By weaving these themes into his travel narrative, Bowling effectively communicates the potential for change and the necessity of addressing these issues within educational settings.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bowling's reflective tone is a key stylistic technique that communicates his underlying message. It signifies a meditative process, a teacher's mind at work, continuously learning and reassessing. This introspection is not passive; it is a call to action for educators to incorporate the lessons of empathy, critical thinking, and social justice into their teaching. His reflection on the proper role of law enforcement, the normalization of violence, and the lack of fear in the face of terrorism, all contribute to a powerful argument for a reformed worldview in the classroom.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>The metaphor of leaving cognitive fingerprints and planting seeds symbolizes the lasting impact teachers have on their students. Bowling's narrative extends beyond the personal journey, symbolizing the journey of education itself. The travelogue becomes a metaphor for the educational journey, one that should be filled with curiosity, questioning, and growth. His stylistic technique of using travel as a metaphor for learning underlines the importance of broadening perspectives to foster a more humane and just society.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Nathan Bowling's travelogue is a masterful blend of personal narrative and societal commentary, employing stylistic techniques that deeply communicate his underlying message. He artfully uses personal anecdotes, contrasting imagery, thematic juxtapositions, a reflective tone, and rich metaphors to advocate for a global perspective in education. His message is clear: educators carry the responsibility of shaping not just academic but also social consciousness. Bowling's travelogue is an invitation to educators to reassess their roles and to students to engage with the world critically and compassionately, reminding us that travel is not just about new landscapes, but about new eyes with which to view the world.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>",

Sometimes the venue changes, but we are constantly thinking about how we can apply what we‚Äôre seeing and experiencing to our practice. This is true, especially during the summer.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>For the last ten years, at the end of the school year, I have packed the same red &amp; black backpack and headed abroad. My travel partner has changed, but the ritual remains the same. This summer I spent four weeks with </span><a href=\"http://www.hopeteague.com/\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>my wife Hope</span></a><span>, an English teacher, traveling through Western Europe: Germany, France, Spain and Portugal.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Early in our trip, after I posted a photo online, a colleague and mentor in the profession, asked ‚Äúwhat does it feel like to be black in Germany?‚Äù I responded: </span><i><em class=\"tde-text-italic\">I always feel ‚Äúmore free‚Äù when we travel‚Ä¶ But knowing what's happening back home, right now even more so‚Ä¶ It's hard to put into words... I feel black + carefree and I haven't felt that way in a long, long time.</em></i></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>When I travel, my brain works differently. I see things here differently. My understanding of America is sharpened by even a brief absence from it. I believe that if you want to be truly awake, you have to leave home. I think most importantly, travel provides me with distance to consider my life back home, what I prioritise, my habits, my consumption and my aspirations. Travel reminds me that there are better, smarter ways.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Travel reminds me of the proper role of law enforcement in a civil society</strong></b><span>. Police killings are a uniquely American problem‚Äîsomething I remind my students of while discussing civil liberties in government class. While we were abroad, at least 95 people were killed by US law enforcement. </span><a href=\"http://killedbypolice.net/\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Victims 630 through 725 of this year</span></a><span>. Travel reminds me that issues of race, justice and policing should be at the forefront of many of our classes this year.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Just before I left for Europe, Minneapolis school cafeteria worker </span><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2016-07-08/shooting-of-mr-phil-shocks-minnesota-school-colleagues\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Philando Castile</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alton-sterling-shooting-police-baton-rouge-shown-in-new-video/\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Alton Sterling</span></a><span> were killed by police. Both were killed at the end of what should have been routine encounters with law enforcement. These encounters were routine alright‚Äîpart of a routine that allows the normalized killing of unarmed Americans by people otherwise sworn to protect and serve them. This fall students will show up to school in Minneapolis wondering ‚Äúwhere Mr. Castile went? This September, Castile and Sterling‚Äôs children will be in our schools. These children‚Äîfatherless because of the actions of other agents of the state‚Äîwill be in our classrooms. What will we say to them? How will we comfort them?</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Travel reminds me there is a better way</strong></b><span>. Traffic stops should not end in murder. People should not be incarcerated for profit. Other industrialized nations don‚Äôt fund local government programs through revenue from red light cameras, placed largely in their poorest neighborhoods. They do not allow </span><a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police-practices/asset-forfeiture-abuse\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>civil asset forfeiture</span></a><span> [the practice of police seizing private property (or funds) they allege have been used in criminal activity for department use and budgets]. These are our problems alone.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Travel reminds me I have nothing to fear from ‚Äúthe Other.‚Äù</strong></b><span> We arrived in Europe four days after the attack in Nice. We expected to find anxiety and fear. We found none. Despite a very real threat from international terrorism, they do not live in constant fear. I want my students to inherit a world where they don‚Äôt have to be afraid.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Travel reminds me of the importance of our work</strong></b><span>. As an educator I get to teach my students a series of lessons, academic or otherwise about government, geography, character and life. As we prepare to return to school, my travel has reminded me that we have an obligation to prepare our students to be active participants in civil society. We must model for them how to thoughtfully question authority. We must implore them to question the underlying and unstated premises of arguments they‚Äôre presented with. We must push them to listen to understand, rather than listening to refute. We must teach them to believe more in discourse and less in debate. We must teach them to love to read and to read to grow.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>This is the work of teaching. We get to help set students on their paths. We get to leave our cognitive fingerprints and habits of inquiry on the next generation. We get to plant seeds. Helping kids become curious about the world isn‚Äôt on my evaluation, but it's probably the most important thing I do. This work can‚Äôt be tested or assessed by the SBAC‚Äîit‚Äôs too important for that. It doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into an ELA standard, but it‚Äôs why we do what we do.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><i><em class=\"tde-text-italic\">Travel reminds me of that.</em></i></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Source:</span><i><em class=\"tde-text-italic\"> </em></i><a href=\"https://www.natebowling.com/a-teachers-evolving-mind/2016/8/25/a-teacher-travelogue-on-what-travel-reminds-me\" class=\"tde-link\"><span class=\"tde-text-underline\">https://www.natebowling.com/a-teachers-evolving-mind/2016/8/25/a-teacher-travelogue-on-what-travel-reminds-me</span></a></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Last Accessed: 23/12/2023</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">In what ways do Bowling‚Äôs stylistic techniques communicate an underlying message?</strong></b></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>",

Our main motivation for visiting the island was to attend our friends‚Äô wedding ceremony. Since we knew that our main priorities were hanging out with our friends and reuniting a couple of long lost playmates, we put very little (i.e. none at all) thought into what we should see or do in Cebu.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our slack attitude totally paid off though. With nothing planned, we were totally and completely free to do whatever our friends suggested. Laziness pays off!

The resort is really close to the airport, which was a major plus considering that traffic in The Philippines rivals that of Indonesia for ‚ÄúMost God Awful EVER.‚Äù</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>The resort seems to be THE PLACE to stay with young kids, and if you ask my children, was a veritable paradise on Earth. There were two swimming pools, a water playground, a beach with almost no surf (perfect for little ones, although Hugo remained steadfast in his opinion that sand is THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD.)</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>I will tell you, though, that this resort is a factory. There are like 1000 beds, and the place is heaving on the weekends. And as with most hospitality institutions of mass production, the food is not good. As in REALLY not good. Which is disappointing, because it is one thing to pay top dollar for fresh, delicious, expertly prepared food. But to pay top dollar for cheap, tepid, pre-ready meals? Well, that's not something I'm willing to do.¬†</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>I suggest if you stay there, stock up on groceries.

But, Cebu offers some amazing opportunity for things to see and do.¬†</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>My children would have been completely happy to spend five days frolicking on the splash pad at the hotel.

Next door was also a little play room for toddlers. However, make sure you bring socks. They're required for using the indoor play gound.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Right off the shore of the hotel beach, there's a coral reef, a fish sanctuary of sorts. It's not in the very best shape (I imagine that it gets a lot of traffic from inexperienced snorkelers) BUT it is quite amazing to be able to step out for an hour and float around and fish watch.

  "<ul><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Authority and Credibility:</strong></b><span> The report cites US Air Forces Central and high-ranking military officials, such as Lieutenant General Alex Grynkewich and General Mark Milley. This appeals to the ethos by leveraging the credibility of the US military to assert the seriousness of the incident.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Specificity and Detail:</strong></b><span> By providing specific details such as the type of the Russian aircraft (Sukhoi Su-35), the nature of the US drone's mission (\"defeat-ISIS mission\"), and the precise action taken by the Russian pilot (releasing flares that damaged the drone's propeller), the report adds to its authenticity and allows readers to understand the gravity of the situation.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Language of Condemnation:</strong></b><span> Phrases like \"flew dangerously close,\" \"blatant disregard for flight safety,\" and \"reckless, unprovoked, and unprofessional behavior\" are strong, evaluative statements that convey disapproval and create a narrative framing the Russian actions negatively.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Juxtaposition:</strong></b><span> The report contrasts the described dangerous manoeuver by the Russian jet with the US's mission to \"ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS,\" thus positioning the US efforts as constructive and the Russian actions as disruptive.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Direct Quotes:</strong></b><span> The use of direct quotes from military officials provides an unfiltered perspective, giving the report a sense of direct communication between the military leadership and the readership.</span></li><li><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Contextual Background:</strong></b><span> The report includes background information on the military presence of both the US and Russia in Syria, as well as the political stance of the Syrian and Russian governments regarding US forces.

Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Russia, Turkey, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bulgaria\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Bulgaria</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Romania\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Romania</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Georgia</span></a><span>, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Oil_spill_near_Black_Sea_as_storm_sinks_three_ships\" class=\"tde-link\"><span>Wikinews</span></a></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Last Accessed: 18/12/2023</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Discuss the techniques the author uses to convey the scale of the disaster and its consequences.</strong></b></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>",

When it comes to literary study, broad concepts can provide a ‚Äúway in‚Äù to a text or pair of texts </span><i><em class=\"tde-text-italic\">and</em></i><span> help you connect literature to real life. After all, we read literature in order to learn more about ourselves, others, and the world around us, and ‚Äì hopefully ‚Äì to become better human beings as a result. Thus, if you can think about a work you‚Äôre reading in terms of what it might teach us about, say, the importance of </span><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">perspective</strong></b><span>, you might better appreciate the work‚Äôs real-life significance.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://cloud.toddleapp.com/thumber/fit-in/1080x1080/https://cloud.toddleapp.com/eu-west-1/p/_oaXnWM/content/rt/uploads/lMLQHN4R5v/hcjohDgOf.png\" height=\"166\" width=\"303\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 13.21.49.png\" /></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">What does this mean for Paper 2?</strong></b></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>As you respond to a question, think about it ‚Äì and your selected works ‚Äì in relation to one or more of the </span><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">course concepts</strong></b><span>. Sometimes, a Paper 2 question will explicitly address a course concept (such as the question, ‚ÄúOften a change of scenery can lead to a change in perspective. Discuss how two of your authors have made use of this idea and to what effect‚Äù). Other times, </span><i><em class=\"tde-text-italic\">you</em></i><span> might need to make the connection. For example, which concepts might relate to, or be illuminated by, this question: ‚ÄúMany works of literature suggest that freedom is often sacrificed for the sake of stability.
