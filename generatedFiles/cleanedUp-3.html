<b><strong class="tde-text-bold">Almora Now</strong></b>
<p></p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Almora in Kumaon, Uttarakhand is 35 kms from where I now live. Notably,
    when I need to shop for provisions, vegetables, fruits, even an envelope to
    post a letter, I have no choice but to go to Almora or Haldwani, 85 kms
    away. That many years ago when I lived in Almora, I knew I would return to
    Kumaon to grow roots. Yet now I avoid the traffic snarls and the haphazard
    concrete of the district town. I prefer the memories of a distant
    past.</span

<b><strong class="tde-text-bold">And in the past…</strong></b>
<p></p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >In the years after I left Almora, it remained a place I could be
    transported to on the wings of my dreams. Just after the milestone that says
    2 kms to Almora, at Bright End Corner, I spent three years watching every
    sunset that was a symbol of the glory of the day completed. If I shut my
    eyes, in the space between the hills of Almora and Sitlakhet, was the Kosi
    river that flows below. Somewhere in the azure skies, somewhere in the thin
    wave of mist, somewhere in the setting sun and the changing colours of the
    skies, somewhere in the inky blue skies of night with the Milky Way
    stretching forever, the falcon flew and stopped mid-flight to remain
    suspended for an age without a name.</span

</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >I remember the summer evening I first reached Almora, and the rainbow in
    the valley before me. I recall the warm welcome of the place I had come home
    to, where it seemed I had belonged for ages past. Was Almora a symbol of
    Kumaon? Was it ia conjunction of time, space, people? I remember my first
    day in Kumaon. And I remember the dream that was no longer a dream…it was a
    lifetime to be lived.</span

<b><strong class="tde-text-bold">Memories that remain</strong></b>
<p></p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >The memories are a flood of quiet moments. Of the quaint market place of
    cobbled stones. Tin roofs on which the rain drummed a different tune each
    time. The smell of pine, and the feel of a bed of pine leaves to walk on,
    with pine cones strewn. Wild flowers that coloured the hills. Flying
    squirrels that glided from tree to tree at dusk. The chameleon that popped
    it’s head out from behind a stone and stared quizzically. Afternoons spent
    on the rocky banks of the Kosi and Saryu rivers.</span

</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >And the friends. There were many. Hours spent over cups of tea and coffee,
    sharing thoughts, exchanging ideas, living dreams, past and future.</span

</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Almora town has changed since. It is a busy bustling town now, where
    traffic wends its way noisily and the winds of change rumble and blare. And
    yet, Almora still beckons me to return to a past that I have found anew
    elsewhere.</span

  <span
    >As the road weaves it’s way up from the railhead at Kathgodam, every turn
    in the road is a familiar place to be, each mile brings me closer to myself.
    And I long to be in the forests of Jageshwar, Mukteshwar and Binsar. I yearn
    for a glimpse of Nanda Devi’s veiled face and the protection of Trishul. I
    may never walk again the Pindari trail in the inner reaches of Almora
    district, but each step is etched within me.</span

    is integrated within me.</span
