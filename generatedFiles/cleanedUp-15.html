Emergency workers were prevented from collecting the spilled oil immediately due to stormy weather; the head of the state environmental safety watchdog Rosprorodnadzor, Oleg Mitvol, said "there is serious concern that the spill will continue". Workers eventually managed to begin work on cleaning up the spill, an effort which may be long-term. Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings. Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Two fuel-loaded barges and </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey" class="tde-link"><span>Turkish</span></a><span> freighter </span><i><em class="tde-text-italic">Ziya Kos</em></i><span> also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov.

The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" class="tde-link"><span>Soviet</span></a><span> times, he said.</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Research" class="tde-link"><span>Ocean Service office</span></a><span> of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sulfur" class="tde-link"><span>sulfur</span></a><span> spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a "hazardous situation", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia. Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Russia, Turkey, </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bulgaria" class="tde-link"><span>Bulgaria</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Romania" class="tde-link"><span>Romania</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)" class="tde-link"><span>Georgia</span></a><span>, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea.</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Source: </span><a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Oil_spill_near_Black_Sea_as_storm_sinks_three_ships" class="tde-link"><span>Wikinews</span></a></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><span>Last Accessed: 18/12/2023</span></p><p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr"><b><strong class="tde-text-bold">Discuss the techniques the author uses to convey the scale of the disaster and its consequences.</strong></b></p><p class="tde-paragraph"></p>
