  "<p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Diction: </strong></b><span>The choice of words such as \"bridging the gap,\" \"crucial role,\" and \"unique approach\" illustrates the author’s perspective that humanities and social sciences are integral, yet under-appreciated, in environmental studies. This diction is intentional, aiming to elevate the status of these disciplines in the environmental conversation.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Structure:</strong></b><span> The column is organised thematically, beginning with a general statement about the importance of humanities and social sciences and then offering specific examples from professors and research fields. This progression from broad to detailed reinforces the central argument's credibility.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Tone:</strong></b><span> The tone of the piece is informative and persuasive. The author uses authoritative sources to support the argument without alienating readers who might favor a scientific approach, suggesting a balanced and inclusive perspective.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Point of View (POV):</strong></b><span> The column employs a third-person narrative interspersed with direct quotations from experts. This choice allows the author to present a more objective argument while also providing the weight of expert testimony.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Use of Quotations:</strong></b><span> Direct quotes from professors serve to legitimise the argument, demonstrating that the author's viewpoint is shared by experts in the field. This is a strategic choice to bolster the column’s persuasiveness.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Appeal to Tradition and Change:</strong></b><span> The column references the \"history of driving social change\" associated with humanities and social sciences, invoking a tradition of impact that the reader is called to continue in the context of environmental studies.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Cultural and Global Perspective:</strong></b><span> By including insights into how colonisation histories affect ecological crises perception, the author appeals to the reader's sense of global citizenship and cultural awareness.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Symbolic Imagery:</strong></b><span> The image's symbols convey a layered social message: a heart conveys empathy, a puzzle globe denotes the complexity of global issues, and the speech bubble with an exclamation mark highlights the urgency of communication. The rabbit emerging from a hat suggests innovative or surprising solutions to these issues. Collectively, these elements form a call to action that is both emotionally engaging and cognisant of the multifaceted nature of social advocacy.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Personalisation of Environmental Issues:</strong></b><span> The use of narratives and art by indigenous cultures to express experiences with climate change personalises environmental issues, encouraging readers to see beyond data and recognise the human aspect of the environmental crisis.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Call to Action:</strong></b><span> The author ends with a quote that serves as a call to action, encouraging engagement and exploration in environmental studies across disciplines. This proactive ending reinforces the social message of inclusivity and collective responsibility.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>",

Contrary to the belief that environmental issues can only be solved through deep scientific knowledge, the humanities and social sciences play a crucial role. They provide a unique approach to connecting the public with environmental concerns, often missed by the scientific community's complex jargon and methodologies.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>These disciplines have a history of driving social change, impossible through science alone. By crafting narratives and offering policy-supporting data, they engage the public on a personal level, making complex environmental issues more relatable.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Political science professor Michael Ross emphasizes the importance of politics in environmental issues, stating, \"The solutions are not mysterious... The real problem is politics.\" His focus is on how cultural, political, and economic factors, especially in the U.S., shape our approach to climate change. Political science, with its data gathering and analysis skills, is vital in this context.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Similarly, humanities deepen our understanding by highlighting how different cultures perceive environmental changes. Ursula Heise, interim director of the Lab for Environmental Narrative Strategies, notes the influence of colonization histories on global perception of ecological crises. These insights are crucial for global understanding, especially in non-western nations and the global south.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Susanna Hecht, a professor at the Brazil Center and Institute of Environmental Studies, points out the role of indigenous cultures in expressing their experiences with climate change through literature and art. These narratives offer perspectives often overlooked in scientific discourse.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Moreover, humanities and social sciences share fundamental research concepts with traditional science, facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration. For instance, both political science and environmental science use data analysis and surveying methods.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Environmental history is another field where the humanities intersect with science. Environmental historians use both scientific data and human records, including indigenous writings in Latin America dating back 4,000 years, to provide a comprehensive view of environmental issues.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Hecht encourages students in humanities and social sciences to explore environmental subjects, stating, \"Get out of your building, go wander around. There’s wonderful things going on.\" This call to action highlights the necessity for all disciplines to engage in the critical study of the environment, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in addressing environmental challenges.</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Source: </span><a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/12/humanities-social-sciences-are-necessary-to-inform-environmental-studies\" class=\"tde-link\"><span class=\"tde-text-underline\">https://dailybruin.com/2023/11/12/humanities-social-sciences-are-necessary-to-inform-environmental-studies</span></a></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><span>Last Accessed: 19/12/2023</span></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><b><strong class=\"tde-text-bold\">Discuss the various elements of this text and how they contribute towards conveying a particular social message.</strong></b></p><p class=\"tde-paragraph\"></p>"
