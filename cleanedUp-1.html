    >Bridging the gap between humanities, social sciences, and environmental
    studies is not as challenging as commonly perceived. Contrary to the belief
    that environmental issues can only be solved through deep scientific
    knowledge, the humanities and social sciences play a crucial role. They
    provide a unique approach to connecting the public with environmental
    concerns, often missed by the scientific community's complex jargon and
    methodologies.</span

</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph"></p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >These disciplines have a history of driving social change, impossible
    through science alone. By crafting narratives and offering policy-supporting
    data, they engage the public on a personal level, making complex
    environmental issues more relatable.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Political science professor Michael Ross emphasizes the importance of
    politics in environmental issues, stating, "The solutions are not
    mysterious... The real problem is politics." His focus is on how cultural,
    political, and economic factors, especially in the U.S., shape our approach
    to climate change. Political science, with its data gathering and analysis
    skills, is vital in this context.</span

</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Similarly, humanities deepen our understanding by highlighting how
    different cultures perceive environmental changes. Ursula Heise, interim
    director of the Lab for Environmental Narrative Strategies, notes the
    influence of colonization histories on global perception of ecological
    crises. These insights are crucial for global understanding, especially in
    non-western nations and the global south.</span

<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Susanna Hecht, a professor at the Brazil Center and Institute of
    Environmental Studies, points out the role of indigenous cultures in
    expressing their experiences with climate change through literature and art.
    These narratives offer perspectives often overlooked in scientific
    discourse.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Moreover, humanities and social sciences share fundamental research
    concepts with traditional science, facilitating interdisciplinary
    collaboration. For instance, both political science and environmental
    science use data analysis and surveying methods.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Environmental history is another field where the humanities intersect with
    science. Environmental historians use both scientific data and human
    records, including indigenous writings in Latin America dating back 4,000
    years, to provide a comprehensive view of environmental issues.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="tde-paragraph" dir="ltr">
  <span
    >Hecht encourages students in humanities and social sciences to explore
    environmental subjects, stating, "Get out of your building, go wander
    around. Thereâ€™s wonderful things going on." This call to action highlights
    the necessity for all disciplines to engage in the critical study of the
    environment, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in
    addressing environmental challenges.</span
